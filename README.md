# ðŸš€ Flight Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit + SQL Server + Python)

I developed an interactive dashboard that helps users explore flight data and analytics using Streamlit, Plotly, and SQL Server.

âœ¨ Key Features:
âœ… Check flight availability between cities with options for non-stop flights
âœ… Dynamic search with date selection
âœ… Visualize flight data through:

ðŸ“Š Pie Chart â€“ Airline-wise flight frequency

ðŸ“ˆ Line Chart â€“ Daily flight distribution over time

ðŸ“Š Bar Chart â€“ Busiest airports based on total flights

âœ… Backend powered by:

SQL Server (T-SQL) for queries and data aggregation

Python (PyODBC + Pandas) for data retrieval and processing

âœ… Highlights:

Clean, user-friendly UI with Streamlit

Real-time data rendering from SQL Server

Modular DB helper class for query handling

ðŸŒŸ This project demonstrates how to build data-driven apps combining Python, SQL, and interactive visualizations for actionable insights!
